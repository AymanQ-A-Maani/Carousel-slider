# General info
I did this project during the front-end phase of an online full-stack Bootcamp provided by an online educational institution called Knowledge Academy, after I was introduced to JavaScript. 
This is an updated version of the autoplay image slider I did in an early stage of this Bootcamp 
# Project's Aim
I wanted to integrate Javascript to my old build and add bullet navigation keys and navigation arrows on each side of the frame.
